                        supersede all prior negotiation, representations or agreements whether oral or written. No change,
                        modification or waiver of any term of this EULA and/or the scope of work under this EULA shall be valid
                        unless it is in writing and signed by both parties.</p>
                    <p><b>ENFORCEABILITY.</b>If any provision of this EULA is declared void or unenforceable, such provision
                        shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to allow enforcement, and all other portions of this
                        EULA shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
                    <p><b>SEVERANCE.</b>If any court of competent jurisdiction or competent authority finds that any provision
